### ⚡ Engineering Doctrine

I don't just research systems; I architect them for **regulatory constraints**, **cost governance**, and **zero-trust environments**.

- **Hardware-Aware AI**
  Deploying inference pipelines that respect the silicon. FPGA acceleration, micro-containerization, and latency-critical optimization.
- **Distributed Reliability**
  Systems that survive partial failure. Consensus (Paxos/Raft), deterministic replay, and CRDTs for eventual consistency in adversarial networks.
- **Platform Governance**
  Infrastructure as Code that enforces policy. SOC 2-ready architectures, reproducible MLOps, and cost-aware auto-scaling.
