### ⚡ Operational Doctrine

My work focuses on the intersection of **hardware constraints**, **economic governance**, and **reliability**.

- **Hardware-Aware Intelligence**
  Optimization at the silicon edge. FPGA acceleration, micro-containerization, and inference latency reduction.
- **Distributed Coordination**
  Systems that survive partial failure. Consensus protocols, deterministic replay, and state reconciliation in adversarial networks.
- **Economic Engineering**
  Architecting for the P&L. Cost-aware auto-scaling, policy-based governance, and SOC 2-ready compliance loops.
